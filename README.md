# Getting Started with PyTorch

This repository provides a simple setup guide to get started using **PyTorch** for neural network projects.  
It includes:
- Environment setup instructions  
- Optional CUDA (GPU) configuration for NVIDIA users  
- A script to install all required dependencies  
- A test script to confirm PyTorch is working correctly  

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:
- **Python 3.8+**
- **pip** (Python package manager)
- (Optional) NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit â€” only if you have an NVIDIA GPU and plan to use it for acceleration

You can verify your Python and pip versions:
```bash
python --version
pip --version
